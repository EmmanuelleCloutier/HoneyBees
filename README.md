# HoneyBees Quests üêùüçØ

## Overview
HoneyBees Quests is a third-person simulation game developed in Unreal Engine.  
The player takes the role of a beekeeper who collects pollen, transforms it into honey (the main currency), and buys bees to assist in their progression.  
The game includes mini-games (Tower Defense, DDR, Puzzle) and quests that unlock new areas and ultimately lead to a battle against a giant insect boss.

3. **Buy bee eggs** to obtain allies.
4. **Complete quests** to unlock new areas and mini-games.
5. **Progression**: unlock all zones, gather all bees, and defeat the giant insect.
